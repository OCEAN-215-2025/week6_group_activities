    "## Introduction to group coding exercises\n",
    "Today you’ll work on this exercise in the same groups of 3-4 you were assigned last week, submitting a single notebook file at the end of the class period. Decide amongst yourselves which member will upload the completed notebook to Gradescope this week. Make sure that everyone takes a turn being the “Uploader”. _You cannot upload the final code two weeks in a row._\n",
    "\n",
    "Designate a different group member to be the \"Reporter\". The Reporter will be in charge of participating in the group discussion at the end of the class session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "Each question will be timed to ensure that everyone gets to work on at least a part of every question. Group activities are not graded by completeness or correctness, but by effort. We will be breaking down each question in the following order:  \n",
    "1. Independent work \n",
    "2. Group work and discussion on coding question\n",
    "3. Group work and discussion on reflection questions\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome and encouraged to communicate with other groups and the teaching team when you feel stuck on a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, we will be grading based best practices in coding. These include: \n",
    "1) Variables are used to store objects\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Make sure that your variable names are meaningful\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Format your code consistently\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Add comments to document your intention, as well as (less commonly) tricky implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Documenting help from outside sources, such as from other groups or online documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "6) Final notebook fully runs from start to finish. A good way to check this is restarting the kernel and fully running through all the cells to check for any errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing your answers\n",
    "In the code cells where you will write your answers, there will be comments denoting:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"**# your code**\"\n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "\"**# answer variables**\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You may store any intermediary variables in the **your code** section. If you do not have any intermediary, you can also store your answer directly in the answer variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Plot Elements for Figures\n",
    "This assignments requires you to create and design figures using `matplotlib`. To practice good plotting practices, each figure will require the following to receive full points:\n",
    "1) Concise, descriptive title for each figure/subplot\n",
    "2) Axis labels with units (when possible)\n",
    "3) Appropriate axis limits (minimum and maximum)\n",
    "4) Appropriate tick resolution\n",
    "5) Legend when using different datasets \n",
    "6) Appropriate font size (a good range is 12-15)"
